# Beat Machine!

## Notes...

Some inspirational machines:

- **Patatap -- http://www.patatap.com/**

  A beautiful sound maker -- visually and aurally. A minimal version is not
  too difficult, but still introduces a number of JS and audio concepts.
  
- **HTML5 Drum Machine -- http://www.html5drummachine.com/**
  
  This one is great in that it would let the students do more, like saving 
  their beats, etc. However, it's also a more complicated project. It might 
  make sense to start with a Patatap-like project, since it's relatively 
  simple, but still introducing many concepts they'll need for a full beat 
  machine.
  
So, what does our *Patatap* look like?

Should we have the kids provide some sort of prompts or instructions to the user? Yes. It would be a good exercise in thinking from the perspective of the user.

We should have some visual feedback (like *Patatap*) on key presses. It can be driven by CSS transformations
