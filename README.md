# Beat Machine!

## Notes...

Some inspirational machines:

- **Patatap -- http://www.patatap.com/**

  A beautiful sound maker -- visually and aurally. A minimal version is not
  too difficult, but still introduces a number of JS and audio concepts.
  
- **HTML5 Drum Machine -- http://www.html5drummachine.com/**
  
  This one is great in that it would let the students do more, like saving 
  their beats, etc. However, it's also a more complicated project. It might 
  make sense to start with a Patatap-like project, since it's relatively 
  simple, but still introducing many concepts they'll need for a full beat 
  machine.
  
  A similar timing-based (but *much more beautiful*) example is Tone Matrix
  (http://tonematrix.audiotool.com/). Also, you can share, which is
  [awesome](https://tonematrix.audiotool.com/_/0.0.830.og0.gg0.s0g.60g.20g.228.8.o8.dg.30.0.g0.g0):

- **typedrummer -- http://typedrummer.com/**
  
  A bit of a hybrid between *Drum Machine* and *Patatap*. Use keys to build a
  beat, but then that sequence becomes a pattern that's repeated continuously.
  Maybe makes sense as a second step, between *Patatap* and *Drum Machine*.
  
So, what does our *Patatap* look like?

Should we have the kids provide some sort of prompts or instructions to the user? Yes. It would be a good exercise in thinking from the perspective of the user.

We should have some visual feedback (like *Patatap*) on key presses. It can be driven by CSS transformations.

We should try to introduce little systematic errors (like leaving dashes out of ID names in one place but not another) so that we can practice debugging with the students as well.
